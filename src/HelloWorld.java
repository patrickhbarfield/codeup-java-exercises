    //recommended.
    //Static: Alot of classes will be blueprints for objects.  ex. cat objects.  The class is the blueprint for what each cat looks like.  It would have
        //properties like, age, breed, color. Static can only belong to the whole class, and not to each object.  A good use are utility methods
    //equiv of console log is System.out.println()
    //sout is the shortcut.
    //no single quotes for strings in java.
